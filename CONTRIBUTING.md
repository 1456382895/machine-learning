# Guidelines for contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this open-source book! We greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before you submit any pull requests or issues. It will help us work together more effectively.

## What to expect when you contribute

When you submit a pull request, our team is notified and will respond as quickly as we can. We'll do our best to work with you to ensure that your pull request adheres to our style and standards. If we merge your pull request, we might make additional edits later for style or clarity.

The source files on GitHub aren't published directly to the official website. If we merge your pull request, we'll publish your changes to the staging website as soon as we can, but they won't appear immediately or automatically.

We look forward to receiving your pull requests for:

* New content you'd like to contribute (such as new code samples or tutorials)
* Inaccuracies in the content
* Information gaps in the content that need more detail to be complete
* Typos or grammatical errors
* Suggested rewrites that improve clarity and reduce confusion

**Note:** We all write differently, and you might not like how we've written or organized something currently. We want that feedback. But please be sure that your request for a rewrite is supported by the previous criteria. If it isn't, we might decline to merge it.

## How to contribute

To contribute, send us a pull request. For small changes, such as fixing a typo or adding a link, you can use the [GitHub Edit Button](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files). For larger changes:

1. [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
2. In your fork, make your change in a new branch (e.g., by [`git branch`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)) that's based on this repo's **master** branch.
3. Commit the change to your fork, using a clear and descriptive commit message.
4. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/), answering any questions in the pull request form.

Before you send us a pull request, please be sure that:

1. You're working from the latest source on the **master** branch.
2. You check [existing open](https://github.com/open-academy/open-learning-resources/pulls), and [recently closed](https://github.com/open-academy/open-learning-resources/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed), pull requests to be sure that someone else hasn't already addressed the problem.
3. You [create an issue](https://github.com/open-academy/open-learning-resources/issues/new) before working on a contribution that will take a significant amount of your time.

For contributions that will take a significant amount of time, [open a new issue](https://github.com/open-academy/open-learning-resources/issues/new) to pitch your idea before you get started. Explain the problem and describe the content you want to see added to the documentation. Let us know if you'll write it yourself or if you'd like us to help. We'll discuss your proposal with you and let you know whether we're likely to accept it. We don't want you to spend a lot of time on a contribution that might be outside the scope of the documentation or that's already in the works.

## Finding contributions to work on

If you'd like to contribute, but don't have a project in mind, look at the [open issues](https://github.com/open-academy/open-learning-resources/issues) in this repository for some ideas. Issues with the [help wanted](https://github.com/open-academy/open-learning-resources/labels/help%20wanted), [good first issue](https://github.com/open-academy/open-learning-resources/labels/good%20first%20issue) or [enhancement](https://github.com/open-academy/open-learning-resources/labels/enhancement) labels are a great place to start.

In addition to written content, we really appreciate new examples and code samples for our documentation, such as examples for different platforms or environments, and code samples in additional languages.


## Notes for contributors

This section describes the development environment setup and workflow
which should be followed when modifying/porting python code and making
changes to one of the machine learning frameworks in the book.
We follow a set of pre-defined [style guidelines](https://github.com/open-academy/open-learning-resources/blob/master/STYLE_GUIDE.md)
for consistent code quality throughout the book and expect the same
from our community contributors. You may need to check other chapters
from other contributors as well for this step.

All the chapter sections are generated by [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/index.html). Start by cloning the repo.

* Clone your repo fork to a local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<UserName>/machine-learning
.git
```
#### Install Python & Conda

Before you start, you will need [Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) and [Conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) on your computer.

#### Install Jupyter Book

Follow the [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/overview.html) official guidance to install the latest version. 

#### Install draw.io

[draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) is needed for generating draw.io-based diagrams in build time. Install the [draw.io desktop application](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases) on your local machine. By default the draw.io execution is correctly located at the platform-appropriate path:

- Windows: `C:\Program Files\draw.io\draw.io.exe`
- Linux: `/opt/drawio/drawio` or `/opt/draw.io/drawio` (older versions)
- macOS: `/Applications/draw.io.app/Contents/MacOS/draw.io`.

Mostly, you don't need to do anything here. The executable will be picked up by [sphinxcontrib-drawio](https://pypi.org/project/sphinxcontrib-drawio/) automatically.

#### Initialize the environment

Clone the source code from remote through your preferred protocol.

```bash
# through HTTP
git clone https://github.com/open-academy/machine-learning.git
```

Move to the working directory.

```bash
cd machine-learning/open-machine-learning-jupyter-book/
```

Initialize the Conda env.

```bash
# first time setup
conda env create -f environment.yml
# or update
conda env update -f environment.yml      
```

You may encouter following problems when you program on ARM-based M1 Mac.

Problem:

```bash
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for tensorflow
```

Solution:

- Step 1: Comment out **tensorflow** in **environment.yml**.
- Step 2: Follow Apple's [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/).
- Step 3:`conda env update -f environment.yml`

Problem:

```bash
error: RPC failed; curl 56 LibreSSL SSL_read: error:02FFF03C:system library:func(4095):Operation timed out, errno 60
fatal: expected flush after ref listing
```

Solution:

**Change your network.**In order to proceed smoothly later, hope you can solve this problem here.

Activate the Conda environment.

```bash
conda activate open-machine-learning-jupyter-book
```

Build the book after you make any changes.

```bash
# official guidance - https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/build.html
jupyter-book build . 
```

You may encouter following problem when you program on ARM-based M1 Mac.

Problem:

```bash
OSError: no library called "cairo-2" was found
no library called "cairo" was found
no library called "libcairo-2" was found
```

Solution:

- Step 1: Install Homebrew:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Run `which brew ` in terminal, if response is `zsh: command not found: brew`, please run the commands in that order in terminal, you'll be editing the path and creating the missing .zshrc file, exporting the path to this new file.

```bash
cd /opt/homebrew/bin/
PATH=$PATH:/opt/homebrew/bin
cd
touch .zshrc
echo export PATH=$PATH:/opt/homebrew/bin >> .zshrc
```

- Step 2: Install the whole shebang of dependencies through homebrew:

```bash
brew install cairo pango gdk-pixbuf libxml2 libxslt libffi
```

- Step 3: Find out the path of `cairo`, `glib` and `pango` installation, and export these to DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:

```bash
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/cairo/1.16.0_5/lib/:/opt/homebrew/Cellar/pango/1.50.9/lib/:/opt/homebrew/Cellar/glib/2.72.3_1/lib/
```

**How to find out above pathes?** Here is an example of cairo:

- Run the command `which brew`.

- Response is `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew`, now we get path '/opt/homebrew/'.(**This depends on your computer!!**)

- Enter `/opt/homebrew/Cellar` in command line and press Tab key. You would find `cairo`, `glib`, `pango` inside.

- Continue to enter `cairo/` in command line and press Tab key, the path will be automatically filled in like `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/cairo/1.16.0_5/`

- Add `lib/` to the end of the path above, you've successfully get ultimate path '/opt/homebrew/Cellar/cairo/1.16.0_5/lib/'(**This depends on your computer!! Remind again.**)

- Step 4: `pip uninstall xcffib` if error still exists.
